# 🔐 Analytical BB84 Engine  

#### **Team Name:** AnalytiQ  
#### **Team Member Name:** Sumit Tapas Chongder [M25IQT013]
#### **Hackathon:** Qiskit Fall Fest 2025  
#### **Project:** Analytical Acceleration of the BB84 Protocol — An Interactive Framework for Quantum Key Distribution Security Analysis

---

## 📖 Overview

This project presents a complete, interactive implementation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol using **Qiskit** and **Streamlit**. It demonstrates how two parties (Alice and Bob) can securely generate a shared key while detecting any eavesdropping attempts by Eve. The system features a dual-backend architecture:

- **Simulator Mode** using Qiskit Aer for correctness validation  
- **Analytical Turbo Mode** for scalable, real-time visualizations of Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER)

Our app includes strategy-aware dashboards, annotated heatmaps, and secure/abort zone visualizations — making quantum security fast, clear, and interactive.

## 🧠 Why BB84?

As quantum computers advance, classical encryption methods like RSA and ECC face potential compromise. BB84 offers a physics-based alternative: any attempt to intercept qubits introduces detectable errors. This project makes BB84 tangible through simulation, visualization, and analysis.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- Qiskit  
- Streamlit  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

### 🧪 Protocol Steps
1. Alice generates random bits and bases  
2. Qubits are prepared in Z or X basis  
3. Eve intercepts and measures (optional)  
4. Bob measures with random bases  
5. Sifting: matched bases retained  
6. QBER estimated from revealed subset  
7. If QBER ≤ threshold → EC/PA → secure key  
8. If QBER > threshold → protocol aborts

## 📈 Results

### Error Checking: QBER + Decoy Yields
- We perform error checking by estimating QBER from sifted bits and validating decoy state yields to ensure channel integrity and detect eavesdropping. 
- The Expected Order should be: Signal > Decoy > Vacuum. Deviations can indicate eavesdropping or channel anomalies. And, the QBER value should be less than the Abort threshold (QBER) value set otherwise, QBER aborts.



### Comparative Visualizations:

## 💡 Innovation

### 5. Error Correction + Privacy Amplification Using Vectorized QKD Simualtion  
- ✅ Threshold-based modeling: We simulate EC and PA using a configurable QBER threshold (e.g., 11%) to decide whether the protocol proceeds or aborts.
- 🧮 Error Correction (EC): If QBER is below the threshold, we assume classical error correction succeeds and mismatched bits are reconciled.
- 🔐 Privacy Amplification (PA): We reduce the final key length based on estimated information leakage.
- ⚡ Vectorized simulation: This approach avoids slow bit-level operations and enables fast, scalable analysis across many parameter settings.
- 📊 Real-time feedback: Users instantly see whether EC/PA succeeds and how much usable key material remains.
- 🎓 Educational clarity: Makes the final stages of BB84 transparent and easy to understand, reinforcing the role of QBER in quantum security.
